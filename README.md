TDD Code Kata for HW3.
======================

The first Kata practice: FizzBuzz - A function
that prints the integers from 1 to 100, but 
for multiples of three print "Fizz" instead 
of the number and for the multiples of five
print "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples
of both three and five print "FizzBuzz".

The first Kata practice: String Calculator - 
A function that takes a string of up to
three numbers and returns their sum. If the
string is empty, it will return 0.
